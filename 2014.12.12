2. Memory management difference between java and c++
Simply speaking,
In java, memory can be divided into stack memory and heap memory. Most of memory management work is done by GC. 
Basic type of data will be put in stack and new() data will be put in the heap memory.

In C++, there are also stack memory and heap memory. The difference is that data in heap memory will need to be released by programmer.

4. How to get hashcode in java
The core code in java is hash = hash*31 + val[off++];
此处，选择31等同于选择31进制，那么如果每位字符的浮动范围在31以内，那么每一位的不同都不可能由其他位的不同来抵消。所以当hashkey里的key是纯英文或者纯数字时，基本不会有重复；而如果以任意字符做Key，则冲突率升高，因此不建议使用

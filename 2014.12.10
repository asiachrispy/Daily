1. 怎样判断链表是否有环？
(1)简单的方法可以是在链表上做记号，如果发现经过同样的node，则表示有环，但会弄脏数据
(2)还可以把node存到hashtable里，每次遇到一个新的node就在hashtable里进行查询
(3)比较好的方法是，使用两个指针，一个每次走一步，另一个每次走两步，若能相遇，则说明有环

2. Fibonacci, Bubble sort, selection sort
bubble sort, compare each two element, and put the big part in the last
selection sort, iterate the whole array to find the minial number and put it to the first place.

3. Thread and Process
(1)Each program in a pc is a process, each process has mutiple threads. Basically, thread is a light process.
(2)Multiple thread can run simultaneously. Take the email system for example, we can have one thread checking for emails and another thread showing a interface for client.
(3)Actually, computer run one thread at one time and switch between different threads.
(4)Multiple threads in a single process share the same memory. By contrast, different processes share different memeory regions and can only communicate through special mechanism.

4. Mutex and semaphore
Mutex is like a lock, it makes sure that in parallel programming, only one thread can access a shared resource at a given time.
Basically, mutex is a integer that starts from 1, when a thread tries to access a resource, the mutex decrease one and wait unitl the integer is positive.
When the thread is done modification, it increase the integer by 1 and the lock is released.

semaphore is more general than mutex
The difference is that semaphore will start from integer bigger than 1. The number used by semaphore is the threads that may access the resources. 
Semaphore support "wait" and "signal" operations, like lock and unlock in mutex.

5. Synchronized methods in Java
In java, each project has a mutex, when a synchronized method is called in the object, the mutex is locked.
This makes sure that only one synchronized method is called in an object in an given time.

6. What is deadlock and how to avoid it? What is race condition and how to avoid it?
Deadlock refers to the situation that two threads block each others. It often happens in resource request.
E.g. T1,T2 both need A and B, T1 request A and T2 request B, so they both need to wait.
The usual solution is to assign an order to the locks.

Race condition is two threads interactive in a neagtive way. For example, the intermediate result of thread A is overwritten by thread B.
The solution is to use lock to prevent the data to be modified. But inappropriate lock will cause deadlock.

7. What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism is the ability of one method to have differnet behaviors depending on the type of object it is being called on or different parameters.
Take constructors for example.
Or the ability an object to take differnet forms. For example, an parent class can reference different child class.

8. How does error handling works?
Basic method is to use try-catch block

9. Do you know what is exception handling?
Normally, there are three kinds of exceptions
Checked exceptions, somethings can be predicted, e.g. IOException
Runtime exceptions, cannot be found in the compilation, e.g. NULLPointer
Errors, severe problem, e.g. out of memory

10. sorting algorithm that is quicker than quick sort
It's possible, for example, flash sorting

11. How does multithreading works? Advantages and Disadvantages? What is the race condition?
12. Memory management difference between java and c++
13. Difference between hashtable in java and c++
14. Is there a hash function which has no collisions?
15. How hashtalbe works?

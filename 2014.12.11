Native bucket sorting, http://www.cnblogs.com/kkun/archive/2011/11/23/2260267.html
Bucket sorting, hashlike sorting algorithm, around O(n)
Counting sorting，O(n+k), k is the largest number
Radix sorting, 按位排序, O(d*(n+k)), d is the number of iterations(logM), n is the length, k is the base number/2,8,10,16
